## 📌 Project Overview

The growing demand for **low-latency applications, IoT processing**, and **5G services** has accelerated the deployment of **edge data centers** in geographically distributed and resource-constrained environments. In such scenarios, **network infrastructure** must be carefully designed to meet stringent limitations in **rack space, power availability**, and **cost**, while ensuring sufficient performance and resilience.

This report investigates the **trade-offs** between performance and infrastructure constraints in the design of **Clos-based network topologies** for edge-scale deployments. A **parametric exploration** of five different topology variants, including **full bisection** and **oversubscribed configurations**, is conducted, with each evaluated under realistic constraints such as **limited rack space** (e.g. 42U), **power budget** (e.g. 5kW), and **cost** (e.g. C20,000).

A specific focus is given to the **Italian context**, where regulatory and infrastructural challenges further complicate the deployment of distributed data center infrastructure. By **modeling and analyzing** these topologies across various metrics—total cost, energy consumption, bisection bandwidth, and space usage, this study identifies **feasible and efficient solutions** for edge network design. The results provide **actionable insights** for practitioners and designers seeking to balance cost-effectiveness and performance in constrained environments.
